# Ruby at Scale

Welcome! This is Gusto’s attempt at collecting a set of tools to help scale Ruby (and Rails) engineering organizations

This is README.md placeholder that we hope to improve over time!

Join us in the [Ruby/Rails Modularity Discourse Server](https://rubyrailsmodularity.com/) to join a community of people interested in these problems! All are welcome.

# Contributing

We welcome and value your contributions to any and all of the repositories in this organization. Please submit issues, open PRs, and contribute your feedback!
