# Ruby at Scale

Welcome! This is Gusto’s attempt at collecting a set of tools to help scale Ruby (and Rails) engineering organizations

This is README.md placeholder that we hope to improve over time!

Join us in the [Ruby/Rails Modularity Slack Server](https://join.slack.com/t/rubymod/shared_invite/zt-23z6gq875-tjoDBhcjmvtSNzl7h_GcWg) to join a community of people interested in these problems! All are welcome.
